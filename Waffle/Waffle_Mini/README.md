# Waffle Mini
The Waffle series is based on the F2800154Qxxx family of automotive processors centered around the TMS320C28x processors from TI.
  
The Waffle Mini specifically is based around the F2800154QRHBRQ1 SKU with a minimal amount of GPIO, however for smaller control applications this is acceptable.
